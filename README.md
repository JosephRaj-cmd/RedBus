This project aims to automate the data collection process for users who need to gather and analyze bus transportation data without manually visiting the website. 
It allows easy access to updated bus schedules and related details, enabling data-driven decision-making for logistics, travel planning, or other applications.
The Bus Routes Scraper is a Python-based web scraping project that automates the extraction of bus route information from the RedBus online bus booking website. 
The script utilizes the Selenium web automation library to navigate the bus booking website, gather details such as bus names, departure times, durations, prices, and seat availability, 
and then stores this information in a MySQL database.
Logistics and Travel Companies: Use the collected data to recommend optimal bus routes or predict price fluctuations for customers.
Researchers: Analyze transportation patterns, route popularity, and public transport efficiency.
Government Authorities: Monitor public transport operations, performance metrics, and use the data for planning improvements in services.
Travel Planners: Retrieve real-time data to better assist clients in finding the best bus routes, fares, and available seats.
This project can be easily adapted to different cities, states, or countries by modifying the scraping URLs and ensuring compatibility with the respective websites' structures.
